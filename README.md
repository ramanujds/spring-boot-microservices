# Introduction to Microservices

## Step 1: Definition
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services, each focusing on a specific business capability.

## Step 2: Characteristics
- Microservices are independently deployable, scalable, and can be developed using different technologies.
- They communicate over well-defined APIs.
- Each service is responsible for a specific business domain.

### Example
Consider an e-commerce application where services like user management, order processing, and inventory management are implemented as separate microservices.

# Problems with Monolithic Applications

## Step 1: Definition
Monolithic applications are traditionally built as a single, tightly integrated unit.

## Step 2: Challenges
- Scalability: Difficult to scale individual components.
- Maintenance: Changes in one part may affect the entire application.
- Technology Stack: Limited to a single technology stack.

### Example
A change in the payment processing module of a monolithic e-commerce application may require redeployment of the entire application.

# What and Why Microservices?

## Step 1: What are Microservices?
Microservices are small, independent services that work together to form a complete application.

## Step 2: Why Microservices?
- Scalability: Easier to scale individual services.
- Flexibility: Can use different technologies for different services.
- Resilience: If one service fails, others can continue working.

### Example
A company adopts microservices to quickly scale its user management service during peak times without affecting other services.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Microservices

## Step 1: Advantages
- Scalability: Easy to scale individual services.
- Technology Diversity: Can use the best technology for each service.
- Resilience: Failure in one service doesn't affect the entire application.

## Step 2: Disadvantages
- Complexity: Increased complexity in managing multiple services.
- Communication Overhead: Services need to communicate over a network, introducing latency.

### Example
- Advantage: An e-commerce company scales its order processing service independently during a flash sale.
- Disadvantage: Debugging a network-related issue between two microservices.

# Use Case for Microservices

## Step 1: Identify the Problem
Identify scenarios where scalability, independent development, and resilience are critical.

## Step 2: Implement Microservices
Break down the application into independent services that align with business capabilities.

### Example
An online streaming service adopts microservices to independently scale its video streaming, recommendation engine, and user authentication services.

# Domain Driven Design

## Step 1: Define Domain
Identify and define the business domain of the application.

## Step 2: Design Microservices Around Domains
Each microservice should align with a specific business domain.

### Example
In an e-commerce application, domains could include order management, inventory, and user authentication, each implemented as a separate microservice.


### Spring Boot Introduction:

**What is Spring Boot?**
- Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework designed to simplify the process of building production-ready applications with minimal configuration.

**Example:**
- An e-commerce application using Spring Boot simplifies the setup of a web server, database connection, and other components.

### Spring Boot Maven Dependencies:

- Spring Boot uses Maven or Gradle for dependency management.
- Starter dependencies are used to simplify the inclusion of common sets of dependencies.

**Example:**
```xml
<!-- Spring Boot Starter Web for web applications -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### @EnableAutoConfiguration:

- Automatically configures the Spring application based on dependencies in the classpath.

**Example:**
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class ECommerceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ECommerceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### What is @EnableAutoConfiguration doing behind the scenes:

- Scans the classpath for specific libraries and configures the application accordingly.
- Uses various AutoConfiguration classes to set up beans and configurations.

### Diving Deep into various AutoConfiguration classes:

- AutoConfiguration classes in Spring Boot configure beans and components based on the project's dependencies.

**Example:**
- `DataSourceAutoConfiguration` configures a `DataSource` bean if there is no existing `DataSource` bean defined.

### @SpringBootApplication:

- Meta-annotation that combines `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, `@ComponentScan`, and `@Configuration`.
- Used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application.

**Example:**
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class ECommerceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ECommerceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### Externalizing configuration in Spring Boot:

- Configuration can be externalized using properties files, YAML files, or environment variables.

**Example:**
- Externalize database configuration in `application.properties`:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce
  spring.datasource.username=root
  spring.datasource.password=secret
  ```

### Accessing Command line properties:

- Command line properties can be passed during application startup.

**Example:**
- Start the application with command line properties:
  ```bash
  java -jar myapp.jar --server.port=8081
  ```

### Application properties:

- Configuration properties defined in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

**Example:**
```properties
# Application properties
server.port=8080
app.title=E-Commerce App
```

### @ConfigurationProperties:

- Binds externalized properties to Java objects.

**Example:**
```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
public class AppConfig {
    private String title;

    // getters and setters
}
```

### Configuring DataSource using Boot:

- Spring Boot can automatically configure a `DataSource` based on the project's dependencies.

**Example:**
- Configure `DataSource` in `application.properties`:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce
  spring.datasource.username=root
  spring.datasource.password=secret
  ```

### TypeSafe Configuration Properties:

- Ensures that configuration properties are type-safe by binding them to specific Java objects.

**Example:**
```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app.datasource")
public class DataSourceProperties {
    private String url;
    private String username;
    private String password;

    // getters and setters
}
```


### Spring MVC REST using Boot:

#### Basics of REST:

- **Definition:** REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- **Key Principles:**
  - Stateless communication
  - Resources are identified by URLs
  - CRUD operations using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

#### Discussion on REST Architectural Principles:

- **Statelessness:**
  - Each request from a client to a server contains all the information to understand and fulfill the request.
- **Resource Identification:**
  - Resources are uniquely identified by URLs.
- **CRUD Operations:**
  - Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

#### @ResponseBody:

- **Purpose:** Indicates that the return value of a method should be directly written to the response body.
  
**Example:**
```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    @ResponseBody
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

#### @RequestBody:

- **Purpose:** Extracts the request body and binds it to a method parameter.

**Example:**
```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @PostMapping("/addUser")
    public String addUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // Logic to add the user
        return "User added successfully!";
    }
}
```

#### HttpMessageConverters:

- **Purpose:** Converts the HTTP request and response to and from objects.
- **Example:** Spring Boot configures converters to serialize/deserialize objects in JSON format by default.

#### Content Negotiation:

- **Purpose:** Select the representation of the resource based on the client's requested media type.
  
**Example:**
```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping(value = "/user", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE)
    public User getUser() {
        // Return user data
    }
}
```

#### Exception Handling:

- **Purpose:** Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error responses.

**Example:**
```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception e) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage(), HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

#### Pagination:

- **Purpose:** Break large result sets into smaller chunks for better performance.

**Example:**
```java
@GetMapping("/users")
public ResponseEntity<List<User>> getUsers(@RequestParam int page, @RequestParam int size) {
    // Logic to retrieve paginated user data
    return ResponseEntity.ok(userService.getUsers(page, size));
}
```

#### Http Entity:

- **Purpose:** Represents an HTTP request or response entity, consisting of headers, body, and status.

**Example:**
```java
@PostMapping("/addUser")
public ResponseEntity<String> addUser(@RequestBody User user) {
    // Logic to add the user
    return new ResponseEntity<>("User added successfully!", HttpStatus.CREATED);
}
```

#### ResponseEntity:

- **Purpose:** Represents the entire HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body.

**Example:**
```java
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<User> getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
    User user = userService.getUserById(id);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(user);
}
```

#### Client using Rest Template:

- **Purpose:** Client-side HTTP access. Allows communication with RESTful services.

**Example:**
```java
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
String url = "https://api.example.com/user/{id}";
User user = restTemplate.getForObject(url, User.class, 1);
```
