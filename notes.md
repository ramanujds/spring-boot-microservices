# Monolithic
A monolithic architecture is a traditional software architecture where all components of an application are tightly integrated into a single codebase and deployed as a single unit. This often leads to challenges in scalability and maintenance.

# SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)
SOA is an architectural style that promotes the use of loosely coupled, reusable, and interoperable services. These services communicate over a network and can be combined to create larger applications. SOA facilitates flexibility and scalability.

# Microservices
Microservices is an architectural style where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate through well-defined APIs. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability, promoting modularity and ease of deployment.

## Microservices Design Principles
- **Domain Driven Design:** Align the architecture with the business domain.
- **Built Around Business Capabilities:** Organize services based on business functionalities.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Loose Coupling:** Services should be independent and communicate through well-defined interfaces.
- **Decentralized Data:** Avoid central databases; each service manages its own data.
- **Failure Isolation:** Isolate failures to prevent cascading issues.
- **Fault Tolerant:** Design services to handle faults gracefully.
- **Continuous Delivery (DevOps):** Enable rapid and reliable application delivery.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Facilitate monitoring and debugging across microservices.

## Design Patterns
### Decomposition Patterns
- **Decompose by business capabilities:** Group services based on related business functionalities (e.g., Patient, ICU, Monitoring).
- **Decompose by Subdomain:** Divide services based on specific subdomains within the overall business context.
- **Strangler Pattern:** Incrementally migrate from a monolithic system to microservices.

### Integration Pattern
- **API Gateway:** Centralized entry point for managing and routing API requests.
- **Gateway Routing:** Direct incoming requests to the appropriate services.
- **Proxy Pattern:** Use a proxy to control access to a service.
- **Aggregator Pattern:** Combine data from multiple services to fulfill a request.
- **Client Side UI Composition Pattern:** Assemble user interfaces on the client side using microservices.

### Database Patterns
- **Database Per Service:** Each service has its dedicated database.
- **Shared Database per Service:** Services within the same business domain share a database.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separate command and query operations for improved scalability.
- **Saga Pattern:** Manage distributed transactions across multiple microservices.

### Observability Pattern
- **Log Aggregation:** Collect and centralize logs for analysis.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Trace requests as they flow through multiple services.
- **Health Check:** Monitor the health of services.
- **Performance Metrics:** Gather metrics to assess system performance.

### Cross-cutting Concerns Patterns
- **External Configuration:** Manage configuration settings externally to facilitate changes without code modifications.

### Service Discovery Pattern
Dynamic discovery of services to enable communication in a microservices environment.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
Prevent cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to a failing service.

### Blue Green Deployment Pattern
Deploy new versions of services alongside existing ones, facilitating quick rollbacks.

# Cloud-native microservices

1. **Codebase:** Use version control systems for collaborative development.
2. **Dependencies:** Manage external dependencies using package managers.
3. **Configuration:** Externalize configurations for flexibility.
4. **Backing Services:** Treat databases and other services as attached resources.
5. **Build, Release, Run:** Separate stages for better control and reliability.
6. **Process:** Design applications to be stateless for scalability.
7. **Port Binding:** Expose services through ports to enable communication.
8. **Concurrency:** Enable applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
9. **Disposability:** Design applications for quick startup and graceful shutdown.
10. **Dev/Prod Parity:** Minimize inconsistencies between development and production environments.
11. **Logs:** Implement logging for monitoring and debugging.
12. **Admin Process:** Separate administrative tasks from the main application runtime.
